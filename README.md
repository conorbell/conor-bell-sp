I want to create an app/website where I can create a grocery list by inputting specific items and utilizing meals I already have in my personal cookbook

I want a button for breakfast, lunch, and dinner

I want a shopping list that sends data to a receipt

I want a database where I can save past grocery lists

I want to submit meals

When I click on meals, I can add the ingredients to my shopping list
and the meals will add to the meal list

At checkout I will be given the grocery list and meal list
I also want the option to save my list

create server
